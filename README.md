This page was built to be a responsive "our team" page using flexbox and CSS grid. My biggest takeaway from this challenge is that grid items don't always have to be positioned using only grid properties - for simple tweaks you can just use `transform: translateY()` and other CSS transforms to shift things around a bit. Another helpful tip is to use the property `writing-mode` to rotate text instead of `transform: rotate()`
